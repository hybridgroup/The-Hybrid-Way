The Hybrid Way
===========

This is the way we do things at the Hybrid Group. It's not the best of the best, but it's the best for us and has worked well.

Usage
--------

The code is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and generated into a web browser friendly version using [yardoc](http://yardoc.org).

Currently there are three sections to be planned

1. Ruby Coding
2. Design
3. Testing
4. [Git](/file.Git.html)
5. Javascript

Each section has its own file in Markdown format and will have their own guidelines and tips and tricks. Long standalone example code can be found in the 'examples' subdirectory.

The eye candy/web browser friendly version of this is available at
[http://thehybridway.heroku.com](http://thehybridway.heroku.com).

TODO
--------

1. Allocate a subdomain for this.

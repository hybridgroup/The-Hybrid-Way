<ul>
<li><p>Do not commit code without green tests</p></li>
<li><p>Your commit message should be explicit and consistent with your committing code</p></li>
<li><p>Remember MEMO: Merge Early, Merge Often</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Where's the Remote?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do not rewrite history on anything that has been pushed to a remote--even if it's not on the master branch.</li>
</ul>


<p>In particular, I'm speaking about the <code>git commit --amend/--squash</code> and <code>git rebase</code> commands. People
might have already fetched it and maybe even merged it to another of their local branches. Those people
might not know commit X was supposed to have been changed somehow, and when they pull again, it'll
either be a broken commit or end up reverting whatever change was made.</p>

<h2>Good Defaults</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Default entries for .gitignore</p>

<pre class="code">  *.DS_Store
  *~
  .rvmrc
  .bundle
  Session.vim
  *.swp
</pre></li>
<li><p>Default entries for .gitignore for Rails</p>

<pre class="code">  config/database.yml
  log/
  tmp/
  coverage/
  db/*.db
  db/*.sqlite3
  public/system/
</pre></li>
</ul>


<h2>Workflow</h2>

<p>When working on a task, make sure you create a branch for that task with the task name and make sure you mark that task as in-progress. The format should be task-#. E.g, task-500</p>

<p><code>git checkout -b task-500</code></p>

<p>When committing to that branch, make sure every commit has at least one complete sentence. You can provide more detail after the initial sentence with a linebreak. (optional) See this guide for more: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html</p>

<p>When the task is completed create a pull request on Github. The title of the Pull Request should include the Task# and what the task is about. E.g, “Task 500: Standardizing GitHub”. Inside the content of the Pull Request, you should include some information on what you did. It’s also a good practice to link to the Task that the Pull Request is related to.</p>

<p>Once you’re done with creating the Pull Request on GitHub, be sure to move the Task to the Pull Request Queue, and to add a link to the GitHub Pull Request inside the Task comments.</p>

<p>I know this is not documented anywhere yet. But fear not! We're working on it.
We'll deliver some solid documentation for you guys to be able to follow a clear path.</p>

<p>For now, you can follow these simple steps:</p>

<p>Grab a task.
Mark it in-progress.
Create a branch.
Commit.
Pull-Request.
Rinse, and repeat.</p></div></div>
